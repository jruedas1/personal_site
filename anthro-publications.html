                <h2>Marubo Discourse Genres and Domains of Influence: Language and Politics in an Indigenous Amazonian Village</h2>
                <h3>International Journal of American Linguistics, 68 (4): 447-482. 2002.</h3>
                <p>This paper explores the distinction between youth-linked and elder-linked discourse genres among the Marubo, a Panoan-speaking indigenous group living in the Javari River Valley of northwestern Brazil. Marubo youth and elders have mastery over different domains of restricted information, expressed in different discourse genres. I compare performances of youth-linked and elder-linked discourse genres in order to understand how mastery over restricted domains of information confers influence on those able to communicate that information. The elder-specific genres confer status and authority upon their practitioners, but this status converts directly to influence only within the realm of social action to which the information at the speakers' disposal pertains. Hence, the elders' speech genre concerning propriety in social relations translates to influence in the fields of marriage and relations among kin. However, the realms of discourse concerning relations with non-Indigenous people are youth-linked: political meetings and radio communications. This confers on the youth a great deal of influence in those fields of relations.</p>

                <h2>Social Context and Creation of Meaning in Indigenous Amazonian Performances of Myth and Oral History</h2>
                <h3>Journal of Ritual Studies, 17 (2): 35-75. 2003.</h3>
                <p>This paper examines the expression and interpretation of knowledge of the past among Indigenous Amazonian Marubo people. I argue that, for Marubo people, there are distinct genres of past-times discourse. This paper first distinguishes these according to their distinct formal characteristics and their forms of social behavior. I will show how Marubo elders interpret traditional song-narratives in the context of concrete, ongoing political processes. A similar analysis is carried out for oral history, showing the significance of oral-historical knowledge to the contemporary Marubo social system. Finally, I show how both genres form part of Marubo feasting practices. The paper traces the knowledge of past-times narratives from performance through moral interpretation to expression in social praxis.</p>

                <h2>History, Ethnography, and Politics in Amazonia: Implications of Diachronic and Synchronic Variability in Marubo Politics</h2>
                <h3>Tipit&iacute;: Journal of the Society for the Anthropology of Lowland South America, 2 (1): 23-64. 2004.</h3>
                <p>This essay critiques frameworks for the study of power in lowland South America by examining diachronic and synchronic variation in Marubo political organization. First, I examine change over time in Marubo politics and how it relates to population fluctuations linked to contact situations. Based on this analysis, I argue that the small, atomized villages that twentieth-century anthropologists perceived as typifying Indigenous Amazonia were products of the specific historical processes. I then show that leaders of different Marubo villages range from powerless to powerful. Thus, it is misleading to label Marubo people as inherently either "egalitarian" or "hierarchical". Based on this analysis, I argue that it is inaccurate to label all Amazonian peoples as egalitarian. Different Indigenous Amazonian peoples should be examined and understood on their own terms within the context of specific historical situations.</p>

                <h2>An "Inca" Instrument at a "Nawa" Feast: Marubo Flutes and Alterity in Amazonian Context.</h2>
                <h3>Burst of Breath: Indigenous Ritual Wind Instruments in Lowland South America, edited by Jonathan D. Hill and Jean-Pierre Chaumeil, pp. 301-324. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011.</h3>
                <p>Marubo flute use presents a mystery, suggested by an elder's statement, at a manioc beer feast, that the flute "is  not Marubo, it is Inca." In this paper, I work to unravel this mystery by placing Marubo flute use in the context of Marubo ritual and musical genres and categories of human. "Inca" is one of a triad of important categories of human that include Yura (Marubo or closely related Panoan people) and Nawa (non-Indigenous people). While describing the flute as an Inca instrument, the same elder described the manioc beer feast as a "Nawa feast," yet this feast was very similar to others described by ethnographers of the closely related Kashinawa. It is an Indigenous ritual form, classified as non-Indigenous by Marubo elders. Thus, in order to understand the meaning of Marubo ritual flute use, it is necessary to understand the Marubo categorization of rituals in terms of classes of human beings. The elder's words indicate a dualism in ritual classiication. Rituals directed by elders are considered Marubo, while rituals directed by youths are classified as non-Marubo. This affects the classification of musical instruments, as the only instrument considered "Marubo" is also the only instrument used in elder-directed rituals, a log drum. Thus, an examination of Marubo flute use reveals distinctions between formal, elder-directed ritual and informal, youth-directed ritual, linked to a system of categories of human. In this paper, I analyze Marubo categories of ritual, music, and persons in order to understand the meaning of the Marubo flute.</p>

                <h2>Indigenous Ritual Action Versus the World System: Marubo Rites of Healing, Solidarity, and Resistance</h2>
                <h3>Revista Espa&ntilde;ola de Antropolog&iacute;a Americana 43 (1): 223-244. 2013.</h3>
                <p>This paper examines the role of Marubo ritual and ceremonial discourse in confrontations with the world sys-tem in its politico-economic aspects. During and after the rubber boom (c. 1890-1920), the ancestral Marubo migrated from their previous locations to a new home in the headwaters of the small rivers of the Javari River, isolating themselves from participation in the rubber economy. There, they built an alliance between distinct Panoan ethnic groups. The alliance was mediated by the development of a new ceremonial system centered on healing rituals and feasts, both categories justified by an ethic of anti-violence, exchange, and mutual care, explicitly thought out as a strategy for surviving the rubber boom. Over time, the alliance became an ethnic fusion, giving rise to a new ethnic identity. At the end of the twentieth century, the Marubo faced reintegration to the world system through incorporation into the Brazilian bureaucracy. Once again they created an intereth-nic alliance, the indigenous organization CIVAJA. This alliance was mediated by the indigenous movementâ€™s political meetings and its discourses on indigenous autonomy and power. The essay concludes by showing a concrete example of the use of the Marubo ceremonial system to invert power relations between indigenous peoples and national bureaucracy.</p>
