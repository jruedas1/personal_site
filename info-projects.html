                <h2>DIGITAL PRESERVATION OF SPECIALIZED INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE REGISTERS</h2>
                <p>My largest ongoing project is to design and create a digital repository for Indigenous Amazonian cultural materials. This project is rooted in my background in anthropology and language documentation. I have conducted nearly two years of fieldwork in Amazonia. During these fieldwork episodes, I have made over 100 hours of audio recordings, over 25 hours of video recordings, hundreds of photographs, and textual materials including transcriptions and translations of Indigenous narratives. I now plan to make these materials available to the originating communities using an open source digital repository application.</p>
                <p>During my first fieldwork, I used some analog processes, including film photography, to document Indigenous language and culture. Afterwards, I digitized all the analog media, moved the digital files to a hard drive, and returned to the host community. I repatriated all collected audio, video, photographic, and textual materials, donating the hard drive to the host community.</p>

                <p>The people I worked with are called the Marubo. They live in the Javari River basin, in  Brazil, near the border with Peru. Marubo people have a rich corpus of sung traditional narratives called <em>saiti</em>. These narratives range from short songs about fifteen minutes long, to songs that take days or even weeks to complete. At the time of my fieldwork, these narratives were fully known only by a few ageing elders. In order to prevent the loss of this oral knowledge, after consulting with Marubo people, I carried out a language documentation project focused on the sung narratives.</p>
                <img src="img/singing.jpg" alt="Elderly Marubo sit on two parallel wooden benches inside a longhouse. One of the elders sings. In the background, young Marubo walk around the center of the longhouse. Bundles of bananas and plantains hang from the rafters.">
                <p>With support from the Foundation for Endangered Languages and the German Foundation for Endangered Languages (Gesellschaft f&uuml;r bedrohte Sprachen, GBS), I spent six months in the Javari River. I worked with the Marubo people to make 64 hours of audio recordings, including 47 sung narratives totalling 31 hours in length. In addition, we transcribed 15 narratives, digitized 43 typewritten and handwritten transcriptions, and translated 8 narratives.</p>

                <p>I now plan to build a digital repository for all the Marubo cultural materials currently in my possession. The repository will make these materials accessible to the Marubo, and be capable of receiving new submissions as needed. I hope to create sound long-term preservation and access conditions for these materials, and eventually turn the repository over fully to Indigenous control.</p>

                <h2>DIGITAL MEDIA COLLECTIONS</h2>
                <p>The <em>Digital Media Collections</em> course at the iSchool was a project-based, studio-style exercise in designing a resource collection.  We focused on conceptual aspects of design including understanding the purpose and audience of the collection, selecting resources, describing and organizing resources, and determining how to present resources to users.  We implemented our ideas using the Open Video Digital Library Toolkit.</p>
                <p>Our main class project was to create a prototype resource collection consisting of approximately 30 videos on the assigned subject of alternative medicine and wellness. We worked to select, describe, and organize the resources to make them appealing and useful to the intended audience. We worked on the information architecture of the digital library and the information design of individual web pages, concentrating on how design decisions can address both the rhetorical goals of the collection designer and the information needs of the target audience.</p>
                <p>Our design process was divided into multiple phases:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preliminary reflections: making explicit our goals and assumptions for the project.</li>
                    <li>User and subject area research: this included building a source library from which we selected collection resources.</li>
                    <li>Creating personas and scenarios to imagine how potential audience members will interact with the collection.</li>
                    <li>Creating a prototype collection showing how the envisioned experience takes form in a specific digital library environment. Developing a system of descriptive attributes and values for resource description and access. Making good use of the Open Video Digital Library Toolkit's built-in metadata and description fields to facilitate navigation, resource discovery, and the user experience.</li>
                    <li>Analysis, critique, and refinement: putting the prototype through multiple design critiques and iterations.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In addition to our digital collection prototype, we wrote a design brief, which went through multiple revisions as the collection design advanced. Our brief described our communicative goals for the collection, our interpretation of the audience and its information needs, and our strategy for reflecting these goals and needs through the selection, organization, and description of collection resources and through the information design of the digital library environment.</p>
                <p>In a final reflective essay, we examined the process of creating a collection experience. I especially focused on the complex negotiation of authorial and audience goals in collection design and on what concepts I had found most useful for creating an appealing and informative collection.</p>
                <p>In addition to critiquing our own collection and our classmates', we analyzed an existing video library to describe how it works as an information experience, from the differing perspectives of audience, author, and information critic.  The design critique was a recurring feature of the overall coursework and design process.</p>
