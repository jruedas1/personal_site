            <p>Full-stack web developer with experience in Java Spring Boot, PHP/MySQL, and Ruby on Rails. I am passionate about organizing, storing, and displaying information. I love to solve problems in database design and follow the flow of information from a user input through the server layers to the data storage layer, and back to the user. I am particularly fond of writing server-side code that mediates between user interface and data storage.</p>
            <p>As a web development instructor at Codeup, I guided teams of 3-5 student developers through the process of creating web applications in Spring MVC, with a wide range of functionalities from allowing gamers to find people with similar interests to play games with, to keeping track of refrigerator contents, to displaying music playlists as album-cover image collages. We used Agile methodology for rapid development of complete prototypes. I had to be highly knowledgeable in every aspect of web app design and coding, from project management through UI design to web security and data storage.</p>
            <p>As a freelance contractor, I have helped clients successfully manage complex tasks in different layers of the web application. I created and maintained a MySQL database with 32 tables supporting a blogging application. I helped improve the user experience of filling out forms on a web app by implementing client-side validation with AJAX to supplement server-side form validation. I advised clients on securing web applications from common security risks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, username enumeration, and brute-force password attacks.</p>
            <p>I use Figma for UI design and implement designs using custom CSS or frameworks such as Bootstrap or Material Design Bootstrap. My goal is always to make it straightforward for users to find the information they need, as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>I have experience with research methods including structured and unstructured interviews and focus groups, as well as quantitative and qualitative statistical analysis of data, including survey data. I am fluent in Spanish, French, and Portuguese.</p>
